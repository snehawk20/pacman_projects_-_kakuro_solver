README

Welcome to the Pacman Project.

The aim of this project is to design an intelligent Pacman agent that moves optimally through the Pacman world and eats all the food dots in as few steps as possible. For this part of the project the ghosts are neglected. The first section involves implementing graph search algorithms such as DFS, BFS, UCS, A* search. The second section involves writing a state space representation for the corners problem and designing and implementing consistent heuristics for the corners problem and the food search problem.

This project is compatible with python 2.
The folder code contains several .py files, of which the ones which have been edited due course of this project are:
search.py
searchAgents.py

The .pdf file l1.pdf contains instructions to the project.
The .pdf file Search_Pacman contains detailed explanations on the search process.
The solutions may be evaluated by -
python autograder.py

The list of commands that can be used to run the individual search algorithms are listed out in commands.txt.

The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 2.7 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution. 
The projects were developed at UC Berkeley and are freely distributed for educational purposes. 
All rights rest with them.
