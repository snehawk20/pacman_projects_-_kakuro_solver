README

Welcome to the Pacman Project.

The aim of this project is to design an intelligent Pacman agent that moves optimally through the Pacman world and eats all the food dots in as few steps as possible.
This project implements minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax and designs two evaluation function, one of them being for a reflex agent.

This project is compatible with python 3.6.
The folder code contains several .py files, of which the ones which have been edited due course of this project are:
multiAgents.py

The .pdf file l2.pdf contains instructions to the project.
The solutions may be evaluated by -
python autograder.py

It can be run for one particular test by commands of the form:
python autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/0-small-tree

It can be run for one particular question, such as q2, by:
python autograder.py -q q2

By default, the autograder displays graphics with the -t option, but doesn't with the -q option. 
You can force graphics by using the --graphics flag, or force no graphics by using the --no-graphics flag.

The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 2.7 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution. 
The projects were developed at UC Berkeley and are freely distributed for educational purposes. 
All rights rest with them.
